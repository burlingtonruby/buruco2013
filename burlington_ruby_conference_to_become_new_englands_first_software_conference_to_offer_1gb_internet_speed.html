	<h2>Burlington Ruby Conference to Become New England’s First
	Software Conference to Offer 1Gb Internet Speeds</h2>

	<h3>BURLINGTON, Vermont - July 25, 2013</h3>

	<p>Burlington Telecom and the Burlington Ruby Conference today announced a partnership to utilize Burlington's high­speed fiber optic gigabit network at the annual Burlington Ruby Conference on August 3rd &amp; 4th at the Main Street Landing. This is the first conference in Vermont to offer 1Gb Internet connection speeds to attendees.</p>

	<p>This year's conference will attract over 150 software developers from across the country to
	Burlington for technical sessions led by some of the top developers and thought leaders in the
	Ruby community.</p>

	<p>"Our mission for the Burlington Ruby Conference is to support the growth of Vermont's
	technology sector by focusing on community," says conference organizer Peter Brown. "Community is the foundation of a strong industry. By offering gigabit internet at the conference, we're showing that Vermont not only has a thriving tech community, but that we have the infrastructure to support it." Burlington Telecom is very excited to have to opportunity to provide 1 gigabit service to Burlington's Ruby Conference, allowing for the showcase of data speeds that are available in very few communities around the country.</p>

	<p>BTV Gig, an initiative to promote gigabit speeds in Burlington states, "Only a handful of
	communities across the United States have access to this caliber of super­fast connectivity. Gigabit is over 100 times as fast as both the average national broadband speed and Vermont's statewide average broadband speed." About Burlington Telecom</p>

	<p>Burlington Telecom is one of a very small number of municipally owned fiber optic networks in the US with the capability of providing a Gbps or higher symmetrical service to the home. This capability has resulted in BT recently accepting an invitation to become a member of US Ignite, the first such member network in the Northeast of the USA US Ignite is a public/private partnership launched at the White House last June to encourage development of next­generation high bandwidth Internet applications that provide transformative public benefit. US Ignite is working to transform how the nation delivers healthcare, educates children, keeps communities safe, trains employees, and manufactures goods. Burlington will be joining a handful of other cities such as San Francisco, Chattanooga TN, Redwing MN, and Kansas City KS and MO, as a part of this initiative.</p>
