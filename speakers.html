          advantage of this in the browser, and how to deploy a real-time ready

            <li>Live Streaming API</li>
            <li>EventMachine vs Rails 4.0</li>

          <p>Community-building can seem like a herculean effort that must be coordinated among many. But it doesn't have to be. One is plenty.</p>

          <p>How can we handcraft a fulfilling code career? How can we support peers in developing theirs, whether newcomer or artisan? How can we contribute, without having to be expert? How do we develop social capital among community members, and channel those investments into people who are just entering? How will we craft a thriving community, using only simple tools &amp; scarce local resources?</p>

          <p>We'll examine the history of major successes -- in Ruby community, Python, and well beyond -- and extract lessons to apply generally. It's a story that weaves in personal narratives of rising into that, both well and clumsily. It's about transforming minor ambitions & frequent iterations into a scope of change that looks amazing. By making choices to do small things well and thoughtfully, rather than with concern for how they scale.</p>

          <p>Heroku has deployed millions of web apps. When you've run that many applications, it's hard not to notice when frameworks and developers do things wrong, and when they do them right. We've taken a look at the most common patterns and boiled down the best of our advice in to 12 simple factors that can help you build your next app to be stable, successful, and scaleable. After this talk you'll walk away with in depth knowledge of web framework design patterns and practical examples of how to improve your application code.</p>

          <p>You've probably already read the GitHub blog post on Unicorn and "Zero Downtime Deploys" and would like to try it out for your application(s). This talk will cover the particular particulars of making this work. Detailed discussion will be given on our Unicorn, NGINX, Runit, RVM, Capistrano and Chef changes that needed to be made in order to make this work reliably. Approaches to migrations and schema changes will also be discussed. Even if your stack differs slightly, the salient points should be applicable. Once you have zero downtime deploys working, you'll wonder why you ever did deploys any other way. Say goodbye to cap deploy:maintenance. Secrets will be revealed!</p>

          <p>Negotiation is a critical part of our lives as programmers. It comes up in many contexts: when starting a gig (salary/benefits, employment or freelance contracts), when ending a gig (severance or debt settlement), and during our everyday lives (disagreements over features/architecture/other project decisions, prioritizing stories, convincing managers to give us time to pay down technical debt instead of just rolling out the next feature, explaining when something won't be possible or what will have to give to make it possible, etc.).</p>
          <p>Effective negotiation and persuasion techniques can seem intuitive and therefore intimidating, but in fact they're simply another set of skills that you can study and practice and learn.</p>

          <p>With the advent of native and single page web apps, APIs are more
          important than ever. An application's API often must serve the needs
          of its own front end(s) as well as any third party applications and
          scripts that integrate with it. It should be flexible, yet follow
          strong conventions to be easily understood.</p>
          <p>This talk will discuss strategies for building an ambitious API with
          Ruby. It will cover diverse topics such as authentication, versioning,
          side-loading and embedding related data, bulk access, and more.</p>

          <p>Despite its anti-enterprise leanings, Rails (and the ecosystem

          <p>Ruby developers enjoy a certain job security, despite the current
          economic climate in the United States and elsewhere. Yet with the
          proliferation of technologies and startups (and subsequently jobs),
          the quality of life of many developers has seen a marked decrease in
          recent years. In an industry in which working 60+ hour weeks is seen
          as a status symbol, and many companies are offering incentives to
          remain at work in the guise of perks and benefits, it can be difficult
          for software developers to achieve a sustainable work-life balance.
          Further, developers often spend a great deal of time outside of
          business hours working on side projects, and consequently, many
          promising careers can lead to immense stress and, ultimately, burnout.</p>
          <p>How, as developers, can we work toward a healthier lifestyle? How
          might devoting time to rest lead to increased productivity at work and
          greater psychological and physical well-being at home? Finally, how
          can we practically rest in ways that lead to more lasting benefits
          than just sitting in our pajamas on Saturday morning and sorting
          through our Twitter feeds? Drawing from recent developments in the
          fields of psychology and cognitive neuroscience, we will explore a
          physiological basis for the relationship between work and relaxation,
          as well as specific, practical exercises to achieve an optimal
          equilibrium between work performance and emotional health.</p>
