          <p>The future is real time! With the Rails 4.0 Live Streaming API we
          finally have the ability to easily add real time functionality to our
          apps. Learn all about the live streaming API, how best to take
          advantage of this in the browser, and how to deploy a real-time ready
          Rails app. Get ready to open your apps to a whole new world of
          interaction and functionality.</p>
          <p>Topics we will cover:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Live Streaming API</li>
            <li>EventMachine vs Rails 4.0</li>
            <li>Node.js vs Rails 4.0 </li>
            <li>Polling vs Live Streaming</li>

          <h4><em>Handcrafting Community</em></h4>
          <p>Community-building can seem like a herculean effort that must be coordinated among many. But it doesn't have to be. One is plenty.</p>

          <p>How can we handcraft a fulfilling code career? How can we support peers in developing theirs, whether newcomer or artisan? How can we contribute, without having to be expert? How do we develop social capital among community members, and channel those investments into people who are just entering? How will we craft a thriving community, using only simple tools & scarce local resources?</p>

          <p>We'll examine the history of major successes -- in Ruby community, Python, and well beyond -- and extract lessons to apply generally. It's a story that weaves in personal narratives of rising into that, both well and clumsily. It's about transforming minor ambitions & frequent iterations into a scope of change that looks amazing. By making choices to do small things well and thoughtfully, rather than with concern for how they scale.</p>

          <h4><em>Millions of Apps: What We've Learned</em></h4>
          <p>Heroku has deployed millions of web apps. When you've run that many applications, it's hard not to notice when frameworks and developers do things wrong, and when they do them right. We've taken a look at the most common patterns and boiled down the best of our advice in to 12 simple factors that can help you build your next app to be stable, successful, and scaleable. After this talk you'll walk away with in depth knowledge of web framework design patterns and practical examples of how to improve your application code.</p>

          <p>You've probably already read the GitHub blog post on Unicorn and "Zero Downtime Deploys" and would like to try it out for your application(s). This talk will cover the particular particulars of making this work. Detailed discussion will be given on our Unicorn, NGINX, Runit, RVM, Capistrano and Chef changes that needed to be made in order to make this work reliably. Approaches to migrations and schema changes will also be discussed. Even if your stack differs slightly, the salient points should be applicable. Once you have zero downtime deploys working, you'll wonder why you ever did deploys any other way. Say goodbye to cap deploy:maintenance. Secrets will be revealed!</p>

          <h4><em>Negotiation for Hackers</em></h4>
          <p>Negotiation is a critical part of our lives as programmers. It comes up in many contexts: when starting a gig (salary/benefits, employment or freelance contracts), when ending a gig (severance or debt settlement), and during our everyday lives (disagreements over features/architecture/other project decisions, prioritizing stories, convincing managers to give us time to pay down technical debt instead of just rolling out the next feature, explaining when something won't be possible or what will have to give to make it possible, &c).</p>
          <p>Effective negotiation and persuasion techniques can seem intuitive and therefore intimidating, but in fact they're simply another set of skills that you can study and practice and learn.</p>
          <p>In this talk, I will explain how to use the negotiation and persuasion techniques I honed during my former legal practice in the context of working as a developer. Learn to protect your rights, argue for the good of your project, and influence the world around you. I'll include lots of citations to studies (because gosh, who doesn't like science and numbers? I certainly do!) and real life examples.</p>
          <p>If possible, this presentation will include audience participation for roleplaying common scenarios where negotiation makes or breaks the moment.</p>

          <h4><em>Building Ambitious APIs with Ruby</em></h4>
          <p>With the advent of native and single page web apps, APIs are more
          important than ever. An application's API often must serve the needs
          of its own front end(s) as well as any third party applications and
          scripts that integrate with it. It should be flexible, yet follow
          strong conventions to be easily understood.</p>
          <p>This talk will discuss strategies for building an ambitious API with
          Ruby. It will cover diverse topics such as authentication, versioning,
          side-loading and embedding related data, bulk access, and more.</p>

          <p>Many Rubyists know Ruby for its ease of use as a web scripting
          language. Many sysadmins know Ruby for its server provisioning
          capacity and as a glue language to the shell. Many Rubyists don't know
          about how Ruby can be used in the world of embedded computing and
          microcontrollers to assist your daily life. Mruby expands the
          capabilities to robotics and hobby electronics, as well as small-scale
          automation. Learn about ways to embed ruby into your daily life with
          heat control, plant watering, helpful robots, and more.</p>

          <h4><em>The Enterprise Side of Rails</em></h4>
          <p>Despite its anti-enterprise leanings, Rails (and the ecosystem
          around it) is built upon many patterns from Martin Fowler's Patterns
          of Enterprise Application Architecture (PoEAA) published in 2002. A
          study of how Fowler's patterns have influenced our Ruby ecosystem can
          help us build better applications and improve our tools.</p>

          <p>This talk will explore the "enterprise" patterns baked into Rails (and
          it's a lot more than just "Active Record"), their implications, as
          well as alternative patterns that don't make an appearance.</p>

          <h4><em>Fighting Burnout: Incorporating Rest Into the Software
              Development Workflow</em></h4>
          <p>Ruby developers enjoy a certain job security, despite the current
          economic climate in the United States and elsewhere. Yet with the
          proliferation of technologies and startups (and subsequently jobs),
          the quality of life of many developers has seen a marked decrease in
          recent years. In an industry in which working 60+ hour weeks is seen
          as a status symbol, and many companies are offering incentives to
          remain at work in the guise of perks and benefits, it can be difficult
          for software developers to achieve a sustainable work-life balance.
          Further, developers often spend a great deal of time outside of
          business hours working on side projects, and consequently, many
          promising careers can lead to immense stress and, ultimately, burnout.
          How, as developers, can we work toward a healthier lifestyle? How
          might devoting time to rest lead to increased productivity at work and
          greater psychological and physical well-being at home? Finally, how
          can we practically rest in ways that lead to more lasting benefits
          than just sitting in our pajamas on Saturday morning and sorting
          through our Twitter feeds? Drawing from recent developments in the
          fields of psychology and cognitive neuroscience, we will explore a
          physiological basis for the relationship between work and relaxation,
          as well as specific, practical exercises to achieve an optimal
          equilibrium between work performance and emotional health.</p>
