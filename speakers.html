          <h4><em>Rails API &amp; Ember.JS - Best of Friends</em></h4>
          <p>The web is about to be reinvented and Rails will once again lead the way, that is if you believe the future of the web is rich client side applications. Rails is a perfect choice for building out a fast and lean API backends and Ember.js is the best client side framework for Rails developers to jump into. We'll go over the concepts of each and just how similar the Ember concepts are to the Rails concepts.</p>

          <h4><em>Handcrafting Community</em></h4>
          <p>Community-building can seem like a herculean effort that must be coordinated among many. But it doesn't have to be. One is plenty.</p>

          <p>How can we handcraft a fulfilling code career? How can we support peers in developing theirs, whether newcomer or artisan? How can we contribute, without having to be expert? How do we develop social capital among community members, and channel those investments into people who are just entering? How will we craft a thriving community, using only simple tools & scarce local resources?</p>

          <p>We'll examine the history of major successes -- in Ruby community, Python, and well beyond -- and extract lessons to apply generally. It's a story that weaves in personal narratives of rising into that, both well and clumsily. It's about transforming minor ambitions & frequent iterations into a scope of change that looks amazing. By making choices to do small things well and thoughtfully, rather than with concern for how they scale.</p>

          <h4><em>Millions of Apps: What We've Learned</em></h4>
          <p>Heroku has deployed millions of web apps. When you've run that many applications, it's hard not to notice when frameworks and developers do things wrong, and when they do them right. We've taken a look at the most common patterns and boiled down the best of our advice in to 12 simple factors that can help you build your next app to be stable, successful, and scaleable. After this talk you'll walk away with in depth knowledge of web framework design patterns and practical examples of how to improve your application code.</p>

          <h4><em>Particular Particulars about "Zero Downtime Deploys"</em></h4>
          <p>You've probably already read the GitHub blog post on Unicorn and "Zero Downtime Deploys" and would like to try it out for your application(s). This talk will cover the particular particulars of making this work. Detailed discussion will be given on our Unicorn, NGINX, Runit, RVM, Capistrano and Chef changes that needed to be made in order to make this work reliably. Approaches to migrations and schema changes will also be discussed. Even if your stack differs slightly, the salient points should be applicable. Once you have zero downtime deploys working, you'll wonder why you ever did deploys any other way. Say goodbye to cap deploy:maintenance. Secrets will be revealed!</p>

          <h4><em>Negotiation for Hackers</em></h4>
          <p>Negotiation is a critical part of our lives as programmers. It comes up in many contexts: when starting a gig (salary/benefits, employment or freelance contracts), when ending a gig (severance or debt settlement), and during our everyday lives (disagreements over features/architecture/other project decisions, prioritizing stories, convincing managers to give us time to pay down technical debt instead of just rolling out the next feature, explaining when something won't be possible or what will have to give to make it possible, &c).</p>

          <p>Effective negotiation and persuasion techniques can seem intuitive and therefore intimidating, but in fact they're simply another set of skills that you can study and practice and learn.</p>

          <p>In this talk, I will explain how to use the negotiation and persuasion techniques I honed during my former legal practice in the context of working as a developer. Learn to protect your rights, argue for the good of your project, and influence the world around you. I'll include lots of citations to studies (because gosh, who doesn't like science and numbers? I certainly do!) and real life examples.</p>

          <p>If possible, this presentation will include audience participation for roleplaying common scenarios where negotiation makes or breaks the moment.</p>
