      <p>
      Our goal is to create an inclusive, respectful conference environment that invites 
      participation from people of all races, ethnicities, genders, ages, abilities, religions, and 
      sexual orientation. 
      </p>
      <p>
      We're actively seeking to increase the diversity of our attendees, speakers, and sponsors 
      through our calls for proposals, other open submission processes, and through dialogue 
      with the larger communities we serve. 
      </p>
      <p>
      This is an ongoing process. We are talking to our program chairs, program committees, 
      and various innovators, experts, and organizations about this goal and about ways they 
      can help us achieve it. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Here are some ways you can help us build a more diverse conference experience: 
      <ul class="left">
        <li>Recommend appropriate speakers and/or program committee members to the 
        conference chairs (see <a href="speak.html">our CFP</a> for program information; you may also send an 
      email to <a href='mailto:info@burlingtonruby.com'>info@burlingtonruby.com</a>
      </li>
      <li>Forward our call for proposals to relevant affinity groups with the message that 
      we are looking for a diverse speaker roster </li>
      <li>Suggest to potential speakers that they submit a proposal during our Call for 
      Participation conference phase (see <a href="speak.html">our CFP</a>  for details) </li>
      <li>Organize community-based public speaking trainings and practice events (Ignite
      is one popular format) </li>
      <li>Suggest ways that the onsite conference experience can be more welcoming and 
      supportive, free from intimidation and marginalization (send an email to <a href='mailto:info@burlingtonruby.com'>info@burlingtonruby.com</a>)
      </li>
      <li>Share your ideas and best practices for how we can realize our vision (send an 
      email to <a href='mailto:info@burlingtonruby.com'>info@burlingtonruby.com</a>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We value diversity in the communities we bring together, and we welcome your 
      contributions to bringing balanced representation of the richness of our collective human 
      experience.
      </p>
